            <p><a href="http://www.baja.ufsc.br/" target="_blank">UFSC Baja SAE</a> is more than motorsport, it is an engineering competition. In order to maintain and improve the quality of the projects and prototypes, embedded systems department division
                is responsible to design a data acquisition, storage and board system installed in the vehicle. Additionally, the system supports mechanical studies to design optimization of vehicle components and real parameters to feedback computational
                models.
            </p>

            <p>In order to evaluate the project, it is presented in the regional, national and international Baja SAE competitions. Only the best 3 teams in the national competition have the opportunity to compete in the international. The feedback from
                the engineer judges is very important to the constant evolution of the projects.
            </p>

            <p>In the regional stage, 10 themes are presented with presentation time of 10 minutes. This project was 2nd among 24 teams. In the national stage, 8 themes are presented with presentation time of 5 minutes. This project was 5th among 74 teams</p>
