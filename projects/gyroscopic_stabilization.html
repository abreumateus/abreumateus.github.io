            <p class="project-title">Gyroscopic Stabilization</p>
            <p class="project-date">July 2016 - December 2016</p>
            <hr>

            <p>This project is the final work of the subject Instrumentation for Control Systems. It is free to choose, develop and present a closed loop physical system that has measurement, control and actuation.</p>

            <p>The project was inspired by the motorcycle <a href="https://www.litmotors.com/" target="_blank">C-1 from Lit
          Motors</a>, a two wheeled vehicle which stands up and reject perturbations by the precession angle control of two gyroscopes.</p>

            <p>However, this project was simplified into a proof of concept two wheeled and single gyro prototype that also leaves from an non-zero initial horizontal inclination, stays upright and reject disturbances.</p>

            <p>The project scored 10/10 and won the prize of the best project in the semester among 12 projects.

                <p>One professor responsible for a theoretical control subject, Dynamic Control Systems, liked the project so much, that he started using it as a physical plant for the students. In order to be easier to replicate the project, he suggested
                    me to redesign the vehicle to be fully 3D printed. Since the first semester of 2017, the project is still a practical activity of the subject.</p>
